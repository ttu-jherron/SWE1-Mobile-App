## 📖 Project Overview
This project is a **mobile application** built with **Flutter and Dart** that enables users to **borrow and lend assets** within a community.  

Users will be able to:
- Create an account and interact with other users
- Borrow or lend items (with full asset documentation)
- Track **price**, **location**, and **condition** of assets
- Manage **preventative maintenance** and **life expectancy** of items
- Earn or spend a **reputation-based currency system** (lending increases points, borrowing decreases them, points can go negative)
- View **most popular items** and search available assets
- Access a **direct purchase link** to suppliers if they wish to buy an item after borrowing
